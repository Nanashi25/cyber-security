## Project Summary

For our project, we tried to create a device using the Arduino microcontroller to execute a relay attack. We were targeting devices that used radio frequency communication in the 315 Mhz to 433 Mhz range, specifically car fobs. Two test environments were created using generic key fobs and an arduino to troubleshoot our device. Although we were unable to replicate the signal from a car key fob, we were able to develop a better understanding of how key fob security has changed over the years.
